MetalÂ³ Installer Dev Scripts
===============================

This set of scripts configures some libvirt VMs and associated
[virtualbmc](https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/environments/virtualbmc.html) processes to enable deploying to them as dummy baremetal nodes.

This is very similar to how we do TripleO testing so we reuse some roles
from tripleo-quickstart here.

We are using this repository as a work space while we figure out what the
installer needs to do for bare metal provisioning. As that logic is ironed out,
we are moving it into the [facet wrapper
API](https://github.com/openshift-metalkube/facet/tree/master/pkg/server), or
the [go-based
kni-installer](https://github.com/openshift-metalkube/kni-installer).
Eventually that kni-installer fork of
[openshift-installer](https://github.com/openshift/installer) will be merged
back, and we won't need much or any of this. For now, these tools are the
canonical way to set up a metalkube cluster.

# Pre-requisites

- CentOS 7.5 or greater (installed from 7.4 or newer)
- file system that supports d_type (see Troubleshooting section for more information)
- ideally on a bare metal host
- run as a user with passwordless sudo access
- get a valid pull secret (json string) from https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install#pull-secret
- hostnames for masters and workers must be in the format master-# and worker-#.

# Instructions

## Configuration

Make a copy of the `config_example.sh` to `config_$USER.sh`, and set the
`PULL_SECRET` variable to the secret obtained from cloud.openshift.com.

For baremetal test setups where you don't require the VM fake-baremetal nodes,
you may also set `NODES_FILE` to reference a manually created json file with
the node details (see [ironic_hosts.json.example](ironic_hosts.json.example) -
make sure the ironic nodes names follow the openshift-master-* and openshift-worker-*
format), and `NODES_PLATFORM` which can be set to e.g "baremetal" to disable the libvirt
master/worker node setup. See [common.sh](common.sh) for other variables that
can be overridden.

## Installation

For a new setup, run:

`make`

The Makefile will run the scripts in this order:

- `./01_install_requirements.sh`
- `./02_configure_host.sh`

This should result in some (stopped) VMs created by tripleo-quickstart on the
local virthost and some other dependencies installed.

- `./03_ocp_repo_sync.sh`

After this step, you can run the [facet](https://github.com/openshift-metalkube/facet)
server with:

```
$ go run "${GOPATH}/src/github.com/openshift-metalkube/facet/main.go" server
```

- `./04_setup_ironic.sh`

This will setup containers for the Ironic infrastructure on the host
server and download the resources it requires.

The Ironic container is stored at https://quay.io/repository/metalkube/metalkube-ironic, built from
https://github.com/metalkube/metalkube-ironic.

- `./06_create_cluster.sh`

This will extract openshift-install from the OCP release payload and
run `openshift-install` to generate ignition configs for the
bootstrap node and the masters.  The installer then launches both the
bootstrap VM and master nodes using the Terraform providers for libvirt
and Ironic.  Once bootstrap is complete, the installer removes the
bootstrap node and the cluster will be online.

You can view the IP for the bootstrap node by running `virsh
net-dhcp-leases baremetal`.  You can SSH to it using ssh core@IP.

Then you can interact with the k8s API on the bootstrap VM e.g
`sudo oc status --verbose --config /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig`.

You can also see the status of the bootkube.sh script which is running via
`journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service`.

- `./08_deploy_bmo.sh`

After running `./08_deploy_bmo.sh` the cluster that becomes active in the previous step
is updated by deploying the baremetal-operator into the pre-existing "openshift-machine-api"
project/namespace.

## Interacting with the deployed cluster

When the master nodes are up and the cluster is active, you can interact with the API:

```
$ oc --config ocp/auth/kubeconfig get nodes
NAME       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
master-0   Ready     master    20m       v1.12.4+50c2f2340a
master-1   Ready     master    20m       v1.12.4+50c2f2340a
master-2   Ready     master    20m       v1.12.4+50c2f2340a
```

## Interacting with Ironic directly

For manual debugging via openstackclient, you can use the following:

```
export OS_TOKEN=fake-token
export OS_URL=http://localhost:6385/
openstack baremetal node list
...
```

## Cleanup

- To clean up the ocp deployment run `./ocp_cleanup.sh`

- To clean up the dummy baremetal VMs and associated libvirt resources run `./host_cleanup.sh`

e.g. to clean and re-install ocp run:

```
./ocp_cleanup.sh
rm -fr ocp
./06_create_cluster.sh
```

Or, you can run `make clean` which will run all of the cleanup steps.

## Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble, try `systemctl restart libvirtd`.

You can use:

```
virsh console domain_name
```

To get to the bootstrap node. The username is `core` and the password is `notworking`

### Determining your filesystem type
If you're not sure what filesystem you have, try `df - T` and the second
column will include the type.

### Determining if your filesystem supports d_type
If the above command returns ext4 or btrfs, d_type is supported by default. If not,
at the command line, try:
```
xfs_info /mount-point
```
If you see `ftype=1` then you have d_type support.

### Modifying cpu/memory/disk resources
The default cpu/memory/disk resources when using virtual machines are provided
by the [vm_setup_vars.yml](vm_setup_vars.yml) file, which sets some dev-scripts
variables that override the defaults in metal3-dev-env
